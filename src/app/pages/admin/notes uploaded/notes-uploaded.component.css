/* No significant custom CSS needed here as Tailwind handles most of the styling. */
/* The table and its cells are styled using Tailwind utility classes directly in the HTML. */

/* If you need to add specific styles that are hard to achieve with Tailwind,
   you can add them here. For example, if you wanted very specific table border styles: */
/*
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
}

th, td {
    border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
}
